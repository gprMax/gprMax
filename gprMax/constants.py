# Data types:
#   Solid and ID arrays use 32-bit integers (0 to 4294967295)
#   Rigid arrays use 8-bit integers (the smallest available type to store true/false)
#   Fractal and dispersive coefficient arrays use complex numbers (complextype)
#                    which are represented as two floats
#   Main field arrays use floats (floattype) and complex numbers (complextype)

# Single precision
# For numpy arrays

# Double precision
# For numpy arrays
