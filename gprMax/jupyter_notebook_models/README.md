## Jupyter Notebook Models

This folder contains several models from the main files of gprMax run on jupyter notebooks.
To run these models on jupyter notebooks, the user has to install the gprMax-devel kernel using the `install_notebook_dependencies.py` file.

The 3D outputs of these models can be visualized using the `plot_3D_model.py` file under `toolboxes/Plotting`

An example output of a 3D model is attached as a `simplesand2.vti.png` file in this folder.
