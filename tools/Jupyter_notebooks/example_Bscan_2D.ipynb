    "The differences between this input file and the one from the A-scan are the x coordinates of the source and receiver, and the commands needed to move the source and receiver. As before, the source and receiver are offset by 40mm from each other as before but they are now shifted to a starting position for the scan. The ``#src_steps`` command is used to move every source in the model by specified steps each time the model is run. Similarly, the ``#rx_steps`` command is used to move every receiver in the model by specified steps each time the model is run. Note, the same functionality can be achieved by using a block of Python code in the input file to move the source and receiver individually (for further details see the Python section of the User Guide)."
