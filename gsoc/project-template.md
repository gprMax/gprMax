# GSoC - Project Template Guidance

We have provided this template to help us learn about you and your proposed project, and to help you formulate and shape your ideas into a well-written project proposal. There are a lot of questions! However, these should help us know more about you and find a good fit, as well as force you to think about the project idea. By working on this proposal, you will already be taking your first steps towards a successful summer. We recommend that you start early and iterate on the application by getting feedback from the mentor.

We have constructed our template using some very helpful examples at CloudCV (https://github.com/Cloud-CV/GSoC-Ideas/wiki/GSOC-2019-Proposal-Template) and Drupal (https://groups.drupal.org/node/459223).

## Basic Details

* Email & Github Username
* Skype Username
* WWW / Blog
* Biography statement (max. 200 words)

## Motivation and Experience

* Describe your motivation for participating in Google Summer of Code?
* Have you participated in Google Summer of Code in the past?
* Why did you choose gprMax?
* Why did you select this project idea?
* What are your expectations from us during and after successful completion of the program?
* What are you hoping to learn?
* How much time will you be able to devote to the project? Are you doing any other internship this summer?
* What kind of projects have you worked in the past? What technologies did you use?
* What is your experience with Python, C, CUDA?

## Project Information

* This is your chance to provide a description of the project idea. What are the major parts of the project? Use flowcharts, diagrams and mockups as much as possible. If your project involves writing APIs, what might those APIs look like?
* Discuss your assumptions
* Mention your deliverables - break down the bigger picture into smaller tasks and explain what these might be.
* If you have found existing work to build on mention it, e.g. if you plan to use a specific algorithm/layer/model/library/framework.
* Include technologies you are planning to use and your familiarity with them.
* Include a weekly timeline for your project from when the coding period begins to the end of the program. One of the keys to a successful project is very good planning. Try to set realistic goals for each sprint, leave a buffer for delays. If you are planning to go on holiday or will be off-the-grid for a few days, then mention those in the timeline.
* How will you deal with project, task, and time management? Will you utilize software? If so, which tool and why?
* How often and by what means will you communicate with the mentors?
* Include what you hope to achieve in the community bonding period. If you feel that there is something that you will have to learn before the coding period starts, mention it.
* Which aspect of the project idea do you see as the most difficult?
* Which aspect of the project idea do you see as the easiest?
* Future Work - what might be the next steps after completion of this project?
