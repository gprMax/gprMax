# GSoC 2021 - Project Ideas List

gprMax is planning to participate in the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) 2021 program, following a successful debut in 2019. Here is list of some potential project ideas (in no particular order):


## 1. Automatic Realisation of AI-Based Electromagnetic Models

The aim of this project is to develop user-friendly tools with which the user will be able to effectively parametrise the investigated problem and define the expected range of the parameters. Subsequently, big data will be generated in an automatic manner to be subsequently used for training a deep learning scheme to predict the electromagnetic (EM) response subject to the parameters of the models. An AI-based real-time EM solver will be orders of magnitude faster than conventional FDTD and it will facilitate electromagnetic imaging, microwave tomography, antenna design etc.  

**Skills required:** Python, Machine Learning, Keras, Tensorflow etc.

**Difficulty:** Hard

**Mentor(s):** Dr Iraklis Giannakis (iraklis.giannakis@abdn.ac.uk), Dr Craig Warren (craig@gprmax.com), Dr Antonis Giannopoulos (antonis@gprmax.com), and Dr John Hartley (johnmatthewhartley@gmail.com)


## 2. An Automatic Framework for Generating EM Big Data

The aim of this project is to develop user-friendly tools with which the user will be able to effectively parametrise the investigated problem and define the expected range of the parameters. 

Machine learning relies on coherent, equally distributed, and well-labelled datasets. Most often, adequate training data are not available, and numerical modelling can provide an alternative platform for generating training data. gprMax has been successfully utilised for this purpose, proving that numerical data can provide a reliable solution when real data are not available. The current project aims at making the process of generating big data trivially available to the end-user by developing a user-friendly big-data module within gprMax.   
 
**Skills required:** Python

**Difficulty:** Easy

## 3. Web-based framework for model building

The aim of this project is to develop a web-based framework that allows models to be graphically built.

Many models, especially for Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR), can be easily specified using a text-based input file, which is currently what is done. This approach can be beneficial when executing large simulations in [high-performance computing (HPC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer) environments. However, there are also simulations that require fine, complex details to be modelled or where existing geometries already exist (for example in CAD format). In these cases a graphical-based model building environment would be beneficial, and one that does not require bespoke software to be installed. A web-based framework would therefore be a very useful for model building and construction.

**Skills required:** Python, web frameworks for 2D/3D visualisation.

**Difficulty:** Medium

## 4. GPU accelerated sub-gridding

The aim of the project is to create use NVIDIA CUDA to accelerate our code for sub-gridded meshes to enable running on GPU. The performance (speed) of the solver is a critical feature as simulations become ever larger and more complex.

The solver is based on the [Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-difference_time-domain_method) method, which has shown significant performance benefits when parallelised â€“ particularly on GPU. Currently we have parallelised using NVIDIA CUDA (with PyCUDA) the main FDTD mesh. The speed-up on GPU is significant (x30 compared to parallelised CPU), therefore we would like to expand this capability to include our code that handles the sub-gridded FDTD meshes.

**Skills required:** Python, CUDA, some knowledge of GPU programming would be beneficial.

**Difficulty:** Medium

## 5. Improved installation tools

The aim of this project is to create a simplified and more user-friendly installation workflow for the software.

gprMax is predominately written in Python, but some of the performance-critical parts of the code are written in [Cython](https://cython.org), which must be built and compiled. The current installation involves building a Python environment, installing a C compiler with OpenMP support, and building and installing the gprMax package. This can be a lengthy and complex procedure, depending on your operating system, especially for first-time or inexperienced users.

**Skills required:** Python, Cython, tools and compilers on multiple (Linux, Windows, macOS) operating systems

**Difficulty:** Medium

**Mentor(s):** Dr John Hartley (johnmatthewhartley@gmail.com) and Dr Craig Warren (craig@gprmax.com)


## 6. Comprehensive test and benchmarking suite

The aim of this project is to develop a comprehensive test suite and benchmarking toolset.

Currently gprMax includes a series of tests that verify specific simulation results against reference solutions. This only tests large chunks of code at a relatively high level. As the functionality and complexity of the code base increases a more comprehensive, fine-grained set of tests is required. The performance of the code is also an important element, as simulations can be extremely large and complex, with some requiring weeks of runtime on [high-performance computing (HPC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer). It is therefore key to have some models that can be used to benchmark code features with both the multi-threaded CPU (OpenMP), and GPU accelerated solvers.

**Skills required:** Python, tools and compilers on multiple (Linux, Windows, macOS) operating systems, some knowledge of GPU and HPC would be beneficial.

**Difficulty:** Medium

## 7. Geometry visualisation

The aim of this project is to improve the handling and visualisation of model geometries.

Being able to visualise and check the geometry and materials of models before running simulations is vital. It minimises the risk of wasting computational resources by running incorrect models. Currently gprMax uses the [Visualization Toolkit (VTK)](https://vtk.org) format to store geometry information to file, and [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org) for visualisation. This allows the geometrical information to be viewed but does not easily permit material information from the model to be checked. A tighter integration is required, possibly considering a browser-based solution.

**Skills required:** Python, familiarity with VTK and Paraview would beneficial.

**Difficulty:** Medium

**Mentor(s):** Dr Craig Warren (craig@gprmax.com)


## 8. Modelling complex materials

The aim of this project is to couple and enhance a series of scripts that have been developed to allow materials with complex (frequency dependent) properties to be modelled.

Often materials that required to be simulated have complex electromagnetic properties that can be frequency dependent. There are several models that can be used to simulate different behaviours, and we have developed an initial [series of scripts](https://github.com/gprMax/gprMax/pull/125) that capture this. However work is required to enhance them (possibly with the option for some graphical input) and couple them with gprMax.

**Skills required:** Python, NumPy, some knowledge of electromagnetic wave propagation.

**Difficulty:** Medium

## 9. Importing geometrical information from laser scanners

The aim of this project is to import geometric data acquired from terrestrial laser scanners. The ability to directly model real objects and topographies without entering their geometries manually would be very useful development.

A laser scanner takes distance measurements in every direction to rapidly capture the surface shape of objects, buildings and landscapes. This information is then used to construct a full 3D model of the object. The data from the 3D model requires to be mapped/converted/translated onto the [Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-difference_time-domain_method) grid upon which gprMax is based.

**Skills required:** Python

**Difficulty:** Medium

**Mentor(s):** Dr Craig Warren (craig@gprmax.com) and Dr Iraklis Giannakis ()


## 10. MPI domain decomposition

The aim of the project is to create version of the solver engine that uses domain decomposition based on the [Message Passing Interface (MPI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface) model.

Simulations are becoming ever larger and more complex, which often means their memory requirements exceed that available on a single machine or [high-performance computing (HPC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer) node. It is possible to use MPI to decompose (or split up) the model domain, and each part can be computed on separate machines or nodes of a HPC.

**Skills required:** Python, C, MPI, some knowledge of HPC environments would be beneficial.

**Difficulty:** Hard
